# Treehouse_Project_4_OOP_Game_Show_App
 Project 4 of the Treehouse FSJS Techdegree Program.  This a 'guess the phrase' game.

# Motivation
Motivation behind this project is to continue my learning within the fullstack JavaScript program. Primarily around enforcing knowledge with classes and how they interact with each other.

# Features
Features include the following:
- Button to start the game.  Also resets the game again if being played multiple times
- Keyboard on screen that user can click to guess letters of the phrase
- phrase is hidden until a user guesses.  Then all the correct letters are displayed.
- User has five lives and can see those go down as they make incorrect guesses
- When five lives are used, a game over screen appears
- If player guesses correctly they get a win screen
- BONUS: User can type on their keyboard to guess letters

# Custom Enhancements
